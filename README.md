# Thesis_VC
This project is based on the [FastSpeech2 implementation](https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2) by Ming24.

The code has been modified and adapted for a cross-lingual voice conversion task, specifically between **Taiwan Mandarin** and **American English**. It includes adjustments to training pipelines, phoneme processing, and prosody integration to support bilingual voice synthesis.

## Datasets

To reproduce the experiments, the following datasets are required (all the needed data had been zipped as one folder):

Make sure to preprocess the datasets according to the structure defined in the `preprocessed_data/` folder and follow the alignment instructions using MFA.
